#Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less than n which divide evenly into n).
#If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a â‰  b,
#then a and b are an amicable pair and each of a and b are called amicable numbers.
#For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110; therefore d(220) = 284.
#The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220.
#Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.

#Process: reused divisors code from ep14. Had some trouble naming and keeping track of values,
#not in a bad way. Got the wrong answer several times checking with projecteuler, which led to trying
#to fix code that was working fine. Turns out I read 10_000 as 1000.
#Also- noticed that the d() funnction returns the divisors AND the number checked.
#Couldn't get into the details of it enough to fix it as I did not write it from scratch-
#fixed it by subtracting the n in the return.
